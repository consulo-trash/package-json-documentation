<h2>author</h2>
<p>The "author" is one person.  A "person" is an object with a "name" field and optionally "url" and "email", like this:</p>
<pre><code>{ "name" : "Barney Rubble"
, "email" : "b@rubble.com"
, "url" : "http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can shorten that all into a single string, and npm will parse it for you:</p>
<pre><code>"Barney Rubble &lt;b@rubble.com&gt; (http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/)
</code></pre>
<p>Both email and url are optional either way.</p>
<p>npm also sets a top-level "maintainers" field with your npm user info.</p>

<h2>contributors</h2>
<p>The "contributors" is an array of "person".  A "person" is an object with a "name" field and optionally "url" and "email", like this:</p>
<pre><code>{ "name" : "Barney Rubble"
, "email" : "b@rubble.com"
, "url" : "http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/"
}
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can shorten that all into a single string, and npm will parse it for you:</p>
<pre><code>"Barney Rubble &lt;b@rubble.com&gt; (http://barnyrubble.tumblr.com/)
</code></pre>
<p>Both email and url are optional either way.</p>
<p>npm also sets a top-level "maintainers" field with your npm user info.</p>

<h2>licenses</h2>
<p>You should specify a license for your package so that people know how they are
permitted to use it, and any restrictions you\'re placing on it.</p>
<p>It is more verbose plural form, then "license":</p>
<pre><code>"licenses" : [
{ "type" : "MyLicense"
, "url" : "http://github.com/owner/project/path/to/license"
}
]
</code></pre>
<p>It\'s also a good idea to include a license file at the top level in your package.</p>
